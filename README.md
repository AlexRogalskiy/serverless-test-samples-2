## Getting Started
How do you use this repository? 

- If you would like to understand the guidance behind the test samples, please read [Serverless Testing Principles](Serverless-Testing-Principles.md). 
- If you would like to implement the test samples in your own project, check out the sample code.

## Sample Code
The sample code in this project will illustrate techniques for creating automated tests in several languages. The samples demonstrate a variety of approaches including testing in the cloud, mocking and emulation. 

### Sample Content

- [Python Samples](./python-test-samples/)
- [Java Samples](./java-test-samples/)
- [TypeScript Samples](./typescript-test-samples/)
- [.NET Samples](./dotnet-test-samples/)

Each runtime sample covers the following topics:
- Unit, Integration and Load Tests
- Mocks and Emulators
- Using AWS SAM during testing
- Testing in the Cloud
- Application Tracing
