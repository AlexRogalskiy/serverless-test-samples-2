# Python Test Samples

This project contains automated test sample code samples for serverless applications. The project uses the [AWS Serverless Application Model](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/what-is-sam.html) (SAM) CLI for configuration, testing and deployment. 

This directory contains the following example projects:
* [python-test-intro](./python-test-intro) : This folder contains introductory examples of Python tests written for AWS Lambda. This is the best place to start!
* [python-test-layer](./python-test-layer) : This folder contains unit tests of for Lambda layers utilizing mocks.
